## About the Sample Solution

### Prerequisites

* The sample solution is a Delphi 10.4 project which also works on Delphi 10.2

* Configure DUnitX by following the DUnitX expert installation instructions in [Stefan Boos: Delphi](https://wonderbird.github.io/pages/software-crafting/programming-languages/delphi.html).

* Clone the [Spring4d Framework (develop)](https://bitbucket.org/sglienke/spring4d/src/develop/) - I am using the interface based collections to have auto-freeing return values
    * In Delphi configure an Environment variable `Spring4d` to contain the directory you just checked out
    * Read more about the collections of Spring4d in [[4]](ref-4)
